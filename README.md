# Sample Interaction
* You: Why do we see only one side of the moon?
* Assistant:
  1. The Moon rotates on its axis just as it orbits the Earth.
  2. However, the Moon takes the same amount of time to rotate once as it does to orbit once â€” about 27.3 days.
  3. This synchronous rotation causes the same side of the Moon to always face Earth.
  4. As a result, we never see the far side from Earth without space probes or satellites.
